<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>imexam is meant as a replacement for the IRAF imexamine task. You should be able to perform all of the important functions that imexamine provided in IRAF, but you also gain the power and flexibility of python and matplotlib.</p>
<p>It currently provides display support with a DS9 window, either one you already have open, or one that imexam explicitly opens. It communicates with the DS9 window through the XPA messaging system. The module is designed so that it may accept other display devices in the future, such as Ginga.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is important to know if you have XPANS installed on your machine and available through your PATH if you plan to use the nameserver functionality. XPANS is the XPA Name Server, it keeps track of all the open socket connections for DS9 and provides a reference for their names. If you DO NOT have XPANS installed, then imexam will still work, but you should either start the DS9 window after importing imexam through the imexam.connect() interface, OR after you start DS9 from the shell, make note of the XPA_METHOD address in the File-&gt;Information dialog and use that in your call to connect: window=imexam.connect(XPA_METHOD) so that communication with the correct socket is established. As a convenience, a full installation of the XPA software is packaged with this module. You may choose whether or not to make use of this. There are lines in the setup.py file which are commented out, removing these will compile the XPA software during the full imexam installation and place a copy of the xpans executable in your scripts directory.</p>
</div>
<p>You can access this help file on your locally installed copy of the package by using the imexam.display_help() call after import. This will display the help in your web browser.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">All information returned from this module should be considered an estimate of an actual refined result,  more precise analysis of the data should be performed for verification before publication.</p>

<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are some tips on installing the package, or tracking down problems you might be having during or after installation.</p>
<p>imexam can be installed from the source code in the normal python fashion:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>python setup.py install</pre>
</div>
<p>If you want to have access to the photometry features of the imexam analysis, download and install photutils - one of the astropy associated packages. It can be found here: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/astropy">https://github.com/astropy</a></p>
<p>If photutils is not installed, imexam should issue a nice statement saying that the photometry options are not available upon import, and any time an analysis key is pressed during the imexam() function loop which requires photutils to render a result.</p>
<p>imexam displays plots using matplotlib, if you find that no windows are popping up after installation it&#8217;s probably the backend that was loaded. One quick way to get things started is to start ipython with the &#8211;pylab option, this will make sure the proper display backend loads when matplotlib is imported:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>ipython --pylab
&gt;import imexam</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="usage">
<h2>Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>imexam is a class based library. The user creates an object which is tied to a specific image viewing window, such as a DS9 window. In order to interact with multiple  windows the user must create multiple objects. Each object stores all the relevent information about the window and data with which it is associated.</p>
<p>For example, in order to open a new DS9 window and use the object &#8220;viewer&#8221; to control it, you would issue the commmand:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">viewer</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">imexam</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;viewer&#8221; now has associated methods to view, manipulate and analyze data in the DS9 session. When you start the connection, you also have the option of specifying a currently open DS9 window using the target keyword. This keyword can contain the name, the actual text name that you gave the window, or the address of the window.  The address of the window can be found in the File-&gt;XPA-&gt;Information menu item,  is stored as &#8220;XPA_METHOD&#8221;, and is of the form &#8220;82a7e75f:58576&#8221; for inet sockets, and a filepath for local sockets.
The following is an exaple of connecting to an already active DS9 window which was started outside of imexam:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>viewer=imexam.connect("82a7e75f:58576")

or

viewer=imexam.connect("my_window_title")</pre>
</div>
<p>When imexam starts up a DS9 window itself, it will create a local socket by default, even though the default socket type for DS9 is INET. However, imexam will first check to see if XPA_METHOD was set in your environment and default to that option. If you are experiencing problems, or you don&#8217;t have an internet connection (the two might be related because the XPA structures INET sockets with an ip address), you can set your environment variable XPA_METHOD to &#8216;local&#8217; or &#8216;localhost&#8217;. This will cause imexam to start a local(unix) socket which will show an &#8220;XPA_METHOD&#8221; that is a filename on your computer. imexam defaults to a local socket connection to allow for users who do not have the XPA installed on their machine or available on their PATH. The full XPA source code is available in the imexam package. If you don&#8217;t have the XPA on your path, simply point it to that location, or copy the xpans executable to the location of your choice, and make sure you update your PATH. Any time DS9 is started it will start up the xpa nameserver automatically. Then all the xpans query options will be available through imexam (such as imexam.list_active_ds9()).  imexam itself uses Cython wrappers around the get and set methods from the XPA for it&#8217;s communication which is why the fully installed XPA is not necessary.</p>
<p>If you wish to open multiple DS9 windows outside of imexam, then it&#8217;s recommended that you give each a unique name. If you&#8217;ve forgotten which window had which name, you can look in the same XPA info menu and use the &#8220;XPA_NAME&#8221; specified there. If you haven&#8217;t given them a unique name, you can list the available windows using imexam.list_active_ds9() (as long as xpans is running) and specify their unique address.</p>
<p>imexam will attempt to find the current location of the DS9 executable by default, but you may also supply the path to the DS9 executable of your choice using the path keyword when you call connect. The fully optional calling sequence is:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>imexam.connect(target="",path=None,viewer="ds9",wait_time=10)

Where target is the name of the ds9 window that is already running, path is the location of the ds9 executable, viewer is the name of the viewer to use (ds9 is the only one which is currently activated), and wait_time is the time to wait to establish a connection to the socket before exiting the process.</pre>
</div>
<p>In order to return a list of the current DS9 windows that are running, issue the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">imexam</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">list_active_ds9</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In order to turn logging to a file on, issue the command: window.setlog(). The log will be saved to the default filename imexam_session.log in the current directory unless you give it another filename to use.
Here&#8217;s an example of how that might work:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>import imexam
window=imexam.connect('ds9')
window.setlog() &lt;-- turns on logging with default filename
window.imexam() &lt;-- all output will be logged to the file and displayed on the screen
window.setlog(on=False) &lt;-- turns off logging to file
window.setlog(filename='my_other_log.txt') &lt;-- turns on logging and sets the save filename</pre>
</div>
<p>The log will look something like this, you can see it contains a mention of the command used along with the results</p>
