=============

Imexam is an affiliated package for the AstroPy package. It was designed to be a lightweight library which enables users to explore image data from a command line interface or through a Jupyter notebook. It can be used with multiple viewers, such as DS9 or Ginga or a simple library to make plots and grab quick photometry information.

It attempts to standardize the interface into these functions so that no matter what viewer is in use the calls and results are the same.
